def to_expectation(paulidict: PauliDict) -> CoeffTerms:
    r"""
    Extract the expectation value expression from a propagated :class:`~pprop.pauli.sentence.PauliDict`.

    In the :math:`|0\rangle^{\otimes n}` computational basis state, only Pauli words
    composed entirely of :math:`Z` and :math:`I` operators have non-zero expectation:

    .. math::

        \langle 0 | I | 0 \rangle = 1, \quad
        \langle 0 | Z | 0 \rangle = 1, \quad
        \langle 0 | X | 0 \rangle = 0, \quad
        \langle 0 | Y | 0 \rangle = 0

    This function iterates over all Pauli words in ``paulidict``, keeps only
    those that satisfy the zero-bracket condition (i.e. only :math:`Z`/:math:`I`
    on every qubit), and concatenates their :data:`CoeffTerms` into a single
    flat list representing the full expectation value expression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    paulidict : PauliDict
        Mapping of ``PauliOp -> CoeffTerms`` after Heisenberg evolution.

    Returns
    -------
    CoeffTerms
        Flat list of :data:`CoeffTerm` tuples whose sum gives the expectation
        value :math:`\langle 0 | O | 0 \rangle`.

    r"""
    Evolve a :class:`~pprop.pauli.sentence.PauliDict` backwards through a list of gates
    (Heisenberg picture).

    Each gate is applied in *reverse* order so that the observable is propagated
    from the measurement end of the circuit back to the input. After all gates
    have been applied, :func:`to_expectation` extracts the symbolic expectation
    value expression as a :data:`CoeffTerms` list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gates : list[pprop.gates.Gate]
        Ordered list of gates as they appear in the circuit (will be iterated
        in reverse).
    paulidict : PauliDict
        Initial observable represented as a mapping of ``PauliOp -> CoeffTerms``.
    k1 : int or None
        Pauli weight cutoff. Evolved terms whose Pauli weight exceeds ``k1``
        are discarded. ``None`` disables this truncation.
    k2 : int or None
        Frequency cutoff. Evolved terms whose total trigonometric frequency
        exceeds ``k2`` are discarded. ``None`` disables this truncation.
    opt : bool, optional
        If ``True``, use optimized pruning strategy. Defaults to ``False``.
    debug : bool, optional
        If ``True``, print the gate, pre-evolution, and post-evolution state at
        each step. Defaults to ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    paulidict : PauliDict
        The fully evolved observable after all gates have been applied.
    expectation : CoeffTerms
        Flat list of :data:`CoeffTerm` tuples encoding the symbolic expectation
        value :math:`\langle 0 | U^\dagger O U | 0 \rangle`.
